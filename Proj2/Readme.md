## How to run

All the cells alredy have the input underneath but if you choose to run the file to verify results you can either run every cell or choose the cells that you want to run. You must first run every cell in "Preparing the data" and the Imports cell if you choose to run just some selected blocks of code. \
The amount of time it takes to run the notebook is hardware dependend but to run everything it will probably take you around 30 min (+ 30 min if you choose to run the cross validation).
